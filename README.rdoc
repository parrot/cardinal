== Cardinal - Ruby for the Parrot VM

Cardinal is a Ruby compiler for Parrot Virtual Machine.

The parser is fairly complete.  The standard library exists, but still needs filling out.

Cardinal's parser is very *very* slow. You can precompile to PIR with
--target=pir and run the result with Parrot directly to skip the parsing phase.
(You may need cardinal.pbc in the same directory for this to work.)

== Getting Started with Cardinal

=== Downloding Cardinal

Get a copy of Cardinal (read only):

    git clone git://github.com/parrot/cardinal.git

=== Build with Rake

After obtaining the source code, run:

    rake cardinal

To run some tests run:

    rake test:all
    rake test:[name]

You might get all rake tasks with:

    rake -T

=== Build with Parrot

You can also build cardinal with Winxed (which comes with Parrot)

    winxed setup.winxed build

Testing:

    winxed setup.winxed test

Note that some of them will probably fail, as Cardinal is not yet complete

If you want to install Cardinal to your Parrot install directory, run:

    winxed setup.winxed install

The compiler will be available as parrot-cardinal
